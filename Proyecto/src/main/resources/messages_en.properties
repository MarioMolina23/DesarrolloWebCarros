carro.audi=Beneath the sculpted bodywork of the Audi A5 hides the Volkswagen Group's MQB Evo platform. It is a well-known architecture, used in other models such as the A4. That means that we can include it within the category of compact saloons, within segment D. The MQB platform leaves us with measurements of 4.69 meters long, 1.84 meters wide and 1.37 meters high. These measures apply to both the coup\u00e9 body and the convertible version, although in this case the height rises 1 centimeter. The five-door unit, Sportback, extends these dimensions, reaching 4.75 meters long, 1.84 meters wide and 1.39 meters high.
carro.bmw=Wide, powerful and dynamic. The BMW X6 combines the imposing presence of a BMW X model and the sportiness of a coup\u00e9. The powerful front end incorporates impressive air intakes that give an idea of \u200b\u200bthe vehicle's power. The large, sport-style double grille emphasizes the athletic presence, while the dual headlights and fog lights, conspicuously positioned on the exterior of the vehicle, lend a distinguished air. Light and dark interior surfaces create strong contrasts, and exclusive materials, as well as standard leather finishes, convey a clear message: essence is perfection.
carro.honda=The interior of the 11th generation Honda Civic is a big step up from its predecessor. Its ergonomics are much more elaborated and its design has a retro-futuristic look that fits perfectly with the design philosophy of the vehicle body. Special mention deserve the air vents, which extend across the width of the dashboard with a nice grille. Everything is at hand at the level of controls and ergonomics, a key point in the development of this generation. The physical controls for the air conditioning are maintained, but the gear selector is buttons, instead of a traditional lever - at least in the non-sports versions.
carro.mitsubishi=The mechanical range of the Mitsubishi Montero is made up of a single mechanical diesel cycle with 3.2 liters of displacement, four cylinders and turbo that delivers a final power of 190 CV. It is mated to a 5-speed INVECS-II sequential automatic cutoff gearbox with sports mode. Engine power is delivered to the ground through all four wheels, thanks to the Super Select 4WD (SS4-II) all-wheel drive system and rear differential lock. The list of finishes and equipment of the Mitsubishi Montero is structured around two versions. For both the 3-door and 5-door bodywork, the possibilities are: Spirit and Kaiteki
carro.toyota=The Toyota Corolla sits on the TNGA (Toyota New Global Architecture) platform and is lower (four centimeters), wider (three centimeters) and longer than its predecessor: the Toyota Auris. The five-door version measures 4.37 meters long, 1.79 meters wide and 1.43 meters high; the capacity of its trunk, in very regular ways, is 361 litres. The Toyota Corolla is a compact with packaging that bets on a striking design with lines with personality, dynamics and a waist that does not go unnoticed. Under that rounded nose appears a black-tone honeycomb mesh occupies the grille located on the front bumper and has chrome inserts on the fog lights.
carro.volvo=At the top of the range is the T8 Twin-Engine version. It combines a 303 hp 2.0 Turbo gasoline engine with a 145 hp electric drive that drives the rear axle. It is a plug-in hybrid, which draws its energy from an 18.8 kWh lithium-ion battery located under the floor of the car, in a central-longitudinal position. It has up to 90 km of 100% electric autonomy according to the WLTP cycle, and the system develops a combined power of 455 CV. Volvo has been characterized in the last couple of years for offering real bargains in its portfolio, as was the Volvo XC40 at the time, which still has an attractive offer.
